## Brief

> - Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
> - Never use a long word where a short one will do.
> - If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
> - Never use the passive where you can use the active.
> - Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
> - Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.
>
> — [George Orwell](https://www.openculture.com/2016/05/george-orwells-six-rules-for-writing-clear-and-tight-prose.html), author and critic

Consider the writing you’ve done this semester. Take inventory of the voice, tone, and style used in your about texts, case study, and CV, then write a simple content style guide that summarizes your personal brand’s voice, tone, and style.
  - See [What is the difference between voice and tone?](https://medium.com/evoking-brand/what-is-the-difference-between-voice-and-tone-5f0fca775520), then Mailchimp’s [Writing Goals and Principles:
Mailchimp](https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/writing-principles/) and [Voice and Tone: Mailchimp](https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/voice-and-tone/) for structure

## Homework

1. Use your *new* content style guide to revise about texts, case study, and CV content. Ask yourself, "Is this me, in writing? Do I sound like this in person?"

2. Use these four tips to revise your content for better accessible writing:

- Aim for an average sentence length of 20-ish words.
- Keep an eye out for any 3- and 4-syllable words, and replace 2- and 1-syllable words. See [Use simple words and phrases](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/words/use-simple-words-phrases/) for reference.
- Use contractions early and often.
- Use [Hemingway Editor](https://www.hemingwayapp.com) to double-check your reading-level (lower is better), fix passive voice, complex words and sentences, etc.
