## Brief

> - Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
> - Never use a long word where a short one will do.
> - If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
> - Never use the passive where you can use the active.
> - Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
> - Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.
>
> — [George Orwell](https://www.openculture.com/2016/05/george-orwells-six-rules-for-writing-clear-and-tight-prose.html), author and critic
