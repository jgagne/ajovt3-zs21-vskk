## Brief

1. Create a [homepage](#homepage) (or home page) for all content from <cite>English for Designers</cite>, including work-in-progress <cite>Storytelling</cite> and <cite>Takeaways</cite>.
2. Create a page listing the top five [takeaways](#takeaways) “things I learned" this semester using text, links, images (optional), etc.


## Homepage

- Create an `index.md` as a table of contents (or home page) for your public website `https://username.github.io/english-for-designers` that links to your various content.

  - See my work-in-progress [home page](https://jgagne.github.io/english-for-designers/) for reference, but only as a starting point, as it is incomplete, and you can do better than this.

  - For example, [`https://github.com/jgagne/english-for-designers/blob/main/index.md`](https://github.com/jgagne/english-for-designers/blob/main/index.md) and [raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgagne/english-for-designers/main/index.md) Markdown file for reference.

  - Double-check the naming of your repo; if you have something other than `english-for-designers` (all lowercase), then please rename.
    1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
    2. Under your repository name, click **Settings**.
    3.  Under the **Repository Name** heading, type the new name of your repository.
    4. Click **Rename**.

-  **Note:** Inclusion of <cite>Composition</cite> is *optional*.
