## Brief

1. Create a [homepage](#homepage) (or home page) for all content from <cite>English for Designers</cite>, including work-in-progress <cite>Storytelling</cite> and <cite>Takeaways</cite>.
2. Create a page listing the top five [takeaways](#takeaways), “things I learned,” this semester using text, links, images (optional), etc.

## Homepage

Create an `index.md` as a table of contents (or home page) for your public website `https://username.github.io/english-for-designers` that links to your various content.

  - **Note:** Inclusion of <cite>Composition</cite> is *optional*.
  - See my work-in-progress [home page](https://jgagne.github.io/english-for-designers/) for reference, but only as a starting point, as it is incomplete, and you can do better than this.
    - For example, [`https://github.com/jgagne/english-for-designers/blob/main/index.md`](https://github.com/jgagne/english-for-designers/blob/main/index.md) and [raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgagne/english-for-designers/main/index.md) Markdown file for reference.
  - Double-check the naming of your repo; if you have something other than `english-for-designers` (all lowercase), then please rename.
    - On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
    - Under your repository name, click **Settings**.
    - Under the **Repository Name** heading, type the new name of your repo.
    - Click **Rename**.
  - Add your homepage URL `https://username.github.io/english-for-designers/` to the Website field in the **About** section (click the gear icon) in your repo `https://github.com/username/english-for-designers` for easy access.
