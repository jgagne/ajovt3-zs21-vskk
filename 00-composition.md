## Brief

> The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

Working from the written instructions generated in class — edit, revise, structure, and add semantics to your text in Markdown using a text editor such a [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io) or [Typora](https://typora.io).

## Details

### Images

Consider inclusion of an image of the expected composition output, as well as the original written instructions and, if possible, the drawn sketch from in class (resized to a width of `1280px` to match linked assets ↓).

#### Linked Assets

1. `![Composition 1](https://jgagne.github.io/ajovt3-zs21-vskk/img/00-composition/01-comp.png)`
2. `![Composition 2](https://jgagne.github.io/ajovt3-zs21-vskk/img/00-composition/02-comp.png)`
3. `![Composition 3](https://jgagne.github.io/ajovt3-zs21-vskk/img/00-composition/03-comp.png)`
4. `![Composition 4](https://jgagne.github.io/ajovt3-zs21-vskk/img/00-composition/04-comp.png)`

### Example

```
# Add a heading; maybe something like, Image to Text?

## Add a subheading (if and when neccessary)?

<!-- This is a comment, a note for yourself or others; maybe add an image (your handwritten instructions)? -->

Add a short description about the warm-up, icebreaker. Keep it short, but meaningful and informative.

- Use an unordered list
- If the order isn't crucial
- But easier to read than a dense paragraph

1. Or
2. Use an ordered list
3. For a more procedural, step-by-step, vibe

## Result or Output? Maybe *Result* is a bit more friendly, but I’ll leave the descriptive wording to you. ;-)

## Handoff

For now, save your `.md` (Markdown) file locally on your device or in a safe, accessible place. Later, next class, we’ll discuss and work together to publish content online.
