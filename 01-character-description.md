<cite>[Hilma af Klint](https://www.hilmaafklint.se/en/), Atom Series, 1919</cite> (via [coa.edu](https://www.coa.edu/live/profiles/1107-catherine-clinger/templates/details/faculty.php))

**Alt text:** `A large painted black serif capital letter O with a white oval center, on an off-white background.`

> Alternative text should be succinct, yet descriptive of the content and function of an image. Lengthy alternative text (more than around 100 characters) often indicates that extraneous content or content that is not available to sighted users is being presented.

1. Design a bespoke character; working from the modern English alphabet, choose a single letterform from A to Z (one of 26 letters) using any style (lowercase or uppercase, sans-serif or serif, cursive or fantasy, etc.) and technique (analog or digital).
2. Write a concise, accessible, and semantic alternative text description of your final letterform artwork as a single sentence in under 120 characters.
    - For example: A close-up of a 16 point ampersand typed in Trebuchet MS viewed in Illustrator’s Pixel Preview mode.
3. Also consider text for a caption: Letter, designer, a list of materials or process, and year.
    - For example: *&*, Justin Gagne. Screenshot of an artboard in Adobe Illustrator. 2017

## Details

### Artwork

Capture and save final artwork in a digital format using these guidelines:

- Size: Use a square with a width and height of `1080 px` × `1080 px` at a resolution of `72 px` (think Instagram artwork size).
- Format: If it’s a photo, save as a JPG; and if it’s *not* a photo, save as a PNG; or if it’s animation or video, save as an animated GIF but consider including an alternative still frame as well.
- Name: Use a meaningful filename, in all-lowercase, and separate words with hyphens. See [Naming guidelines](https://developers.google.com/style/filenames) and <cite>[Dashes vs. underscores](https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/dashes-vs-underscores/)</cite> for details.
  - Use the filename convention of case, letter, first name initial followed by last name (surname) combined with the best practice of all-lowercase and separate words with hyphens.
    - For example: `uppercase-p-lsutnar.png`

**Note:**

- Keep artwork and text as separate pieces of content.

**Optional:**

- Collect and save sketches to document your process (as a case study).

### Text

- Write your description as a single sentence in sentence case; start with a capital letter and end with a period.
- Keep your description short; aim for 120 characters or less.

**Note:**

- Capitalize abbreviations and acronyms, but remove ampersands.
  - For example: The acronym (and brand) “C&A” becomes “C and A”.

## Handoff

## Homework

1. Add an **Issue** to your repo with revised versions of your alt text, focusing on the aesthetic and [emotion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flf2vS0IoRs)-related content in the artwork. Also, consider the overall impression and readability of the description.

- For example, [this issue](https://github.com/jgagne/english-for-designers/issues/1) based on [Eva Junková’s alt text](https://evajunkova.github.io/english-for-designers/00-composition/01-character-description):

```
## Alt Text Edits

2. The letter O made of koi fish, 2 fish forming a circle, calm and peaceful illustration.

3. The letter O made of illustrated koi fish, 2 fish forming a circle calm and peaceful.

4. The letter O made of two koi fish forming an oval, in pen and ink, swimming on a peaceful ink wash background.

```

2. Please review artwork [requirements](#details), then update and optimize all images for performance (and accessibility) via Photoshop and optimization tools (as listed below).

**Note:**

- Aim for an optimized image file size around `200 KB` and below.

### Save for Web

#### Photoshop

- In Photoshop: save images using Photoshop, `File` > `Export` > `Save for Web (Legacy)…`
  - Save photographs as a JPG (`.jpg`) using the preset `JPEG High` or `JPEG Medium` (depending on quality and file size)
  - Save illustrations as a PNG (`.png`) using the preset `PNG-8 128 Dithered` (less colors, max 256) or `PNG-24` (more colors, millions).

### Optimization Tools

#### Mac-based
- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com)
  - Enable all image optimizations options (specifically `Guetzli`) via `ImageOptim` > `Preferences…` > `Enable` (left sidebar in General settings).
- [ImageAlpha](https://pngmini.com) for alpha and transparency heavy images

#### Web-based
- [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app)
  - Use `MozJPEG` to optimize JPGs and use `OptiPNG` to optimize PNGs. (You may resize an image in Squoosh, if needed.)
