## Brief

> As a law student, I went on a few job interviews. At one, the interviewer’s first comment was “It’s so unusual that I see a résumé without any typos.”
>
>—[Matthew Butterick](https://practicaltypography.com), [résumés](https://practicaltypography.com/resumes.html)

> Content precedes design. Design in the absence of content is not design, it’s decoration.

Content first — write and structure a résumé/CV (curriculum vitae) in Markdown, and design second — typeset and layout a downloadable PDF.

1. Use Markdown to focus on content first, *unstyled*, meaningful structure, semantics, and accessibility.
2. Use your design tool of choice to focus on design second, *styled* typography and layout (multi-column) using your Markdown document as the source of truth for content, structure, semantics, and accessibility, then export/save as a PDF.
  - See [Typography in ten minutes](https://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html) and [résumés](https://practicaltypography.com/resumes.html) for guidance.

**Notes:**

  - As a best practice, keep your résumé/CV black and white, and if you do use color, make sure it is accessible, meeting color contrast guidelines.
    - For example:
        - Caroline Win’s headings in blue (`#1da2d8`) fails WCAG 2.0 guidelines for [contrast accessibility](https://accessible-colors.com). Color should be an inclusive enhancement, not a potential barrier.


## Handoff

Share a link to your work in the `04-experience` channel in Slack.

### GitHub Config

- Create a project folder (repo) with a Markdown file and a PDF file.
  - For example:
    - `04-experience`
      - `index.md`
      - `pdf`
        - `cv-2021-11-jgagne.pdf`

**Notes:**

- It’s useful to add the year, YYYY, or year and month, YYYY-MM, to the filename to keep yourself current.
- Also as a reminder, use of a first name initial followed by last name (surname) combined with the best practice of all-lowercase and separate words with hyphens helps to keep the filename short, accessible, and readable.

### Markdown Files

- `index.md`

```
<!-- Use Markdown for headings, paragraphs, lists, etc. to add structural meaning to your content. -->

<!-- Name, about short decription, contact info? -->

<!-- Education or Experience first? -->

## Experience

<!-- Sort by newest (present) to oldest. -->

## Education

<!-- Higher education, not high school unless it's a speciality/vocational school worth mentioning. -->

## Skills

<!-- Not just software, please! See Caroline Win’s skills section: https://www.carolinewin.com/resume -->

- [Download CV (PDF)](pdf/cv-2021-11-jgagne.pdf) <!-- At the top or bottom? -->

## Homework

Revise résumé/CV about me and/or work experience text to better align with a PAR (problem, action, and result) focused [voice and tone](https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/voice-and-tone/):

### About Me

1. What problems will you solve for the employer?
2. What actions will you take to get the job done?
3. What makes you a successful designer?

- For example, but you do better than this and with personality:
> I focus on design that is intuitive, thoughtful, and balanced.
I value collaboration and getting the details right.
>
>  —[Caroline Win](https://www.carolinewin.com)

### Work Experience

1. What problem did the project solve?
2. What actions did you take to do this project?
3. How successful were you in solving the problem?
    - What were the results of the project?

- For example:
> I led the video product team as well as the Audience
Experience team at Vox Media. My work spanned creating the
best editorial consumption experiences for our audience on
all platforms as well as building the systems and tools used
to empower the editorial staff.

## Vocabulary

- **Soft skills**
  - Personal attributes that enable someone to interact effectively and harmoniously with other people. Storytelling is an essential soft skill that enhances a designer’s ability to better communicate and deliver more compelling design experiences.
- **En dash**
  - The en dash (–) is slightly wider punctuation mark than the hyphen (-) but narrower than the em dash (—). The en dash is used to represent a span or range of numbers, dates, or time.
- **Em dash**
  - Do not mistake the em dash (—) for the slightly narrower en dash (–) or the even narrower hyphen (-). The em dash is perhaps the most versatile punctuation mark. Depending on the context, the em dash can take the place of commas, parentheses, or colons⁠ — in each case to slightly different effect.
- **Oxford comma (serial comma)**
  - The final comma in a list of items is known as an Oxford comma or serial comma. Some writers omit the Oxford comma, but doing so can cause confusion. Empathy, listening, and critical thinking are soft skills that software won’t ever replace — oh, and good writing.
- **Home page (homepage)**
  - The first and main page or screen (home screen, homescreen, or start screen) of a digital experience within a website, app, or device. The home page of the first website can be viewed at [http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html)
