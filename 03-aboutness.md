## Brief

1. Write a concise, single sentence about yourself as a designer, in under 120 characters in length.
    - Examples:
      - I am Chaitanya, product designer, mother and a photography enthusiast currently living in San Francisco. (`104 characters`)
      - Amanda Pinsker—Experience designer. I like to rethink things through experimentation, compassion, and a sense of humor. (`119 characters`)
2. *(Maybe start here first.)* Write a series of short paragraphs (one to three) about who you are, beyond being a designer; a personal bio that tells your story, with an emphasis on keywords about what you do, your passions, experience, etc. Consider each paragraph as two to three short, meaningful descriptions (120 characters each).
    - See [About Me](#about-me) for examples.
3. Choose a project to develop as a case study for your portfolio and write about the process using the PAR and RAD content methods. Aim for around 500 *words* (not characters).
    - See [Case Studies](#case-studies) for examples.

- **Note:** Don’t worry about length — write first — then edit for clarity and conciseness later.

## Warm-Up

Consider generating a keyword list to start the process of writing:

- designer
- rethink
- experimentation
- compassion
- humor

## Methods

### PAR

Problem, action, and result:

1. What problem did the project solve?
2. What actions did you take to do this project?
3. How successful were you in solving the problem?
    - What were the results of the project?
- See [Crafting Your Story](https://thegymnasium.com/take5/crafting-your-story)

### RAD

Lean content is reliable, authentic, and direct language (this builds the reader’s trust and confidence).

1. Reliable
    - It sets and meets the reader’s expectations; it’s consistent throughout each piece of content.
2. Authentic
    - If feels like a real conversation is happening; the language is natural and clear.
3. Direct
    - It gives you exactly what you need to make a decision.
- See [5 mins on Lean Content](https://stephaniehay.com/2012/12/24/lean-content-testing-marketing-copy-instead-of-spinning-your-wheels/)

## Handoff

Share your repo URL in the `03-aboutness` project channel of your Slack workspace.

### GitHub Config

- Create a project folder (repo) with two Markdown files, plus an `img` folder with images.
  - For example:
    - `03-aboutness`
      - `index.md`
      - `case-study.md`
      - `img`
        - `filename.png`
        - `…`

### Markdown Files

- `index.md`

```
# Your Name

## About Me

A concise, single sentence about yourself as a designer (aim for about 100 characers).

- [View Selected Case Study](case-study.md) <!-- A link to your case study -->

## My Story

![Alt text description.](img/lsutnar-headshot.png) <! -- Maybe a photo of yourself? -->

A series of short paragraphs (one to three) about who you are, beyond being a designer; a personal bio that tells your story, with an emphasis on keywords about what you do, your passions, experience, etc. Consider each paragraph as two to three short, meaningful descriptions (120 characters each). Don’t worry about length — write first — then edit for clarity and conciseness later.
```

- `case-study.md`

```
# Project Title

Content goes here…

![Alt text description.](img/filename.png)

Note: Use Markdown for headings, paragraphs, lists, quotes, images, etc., to add structural meaning to your content.
```

### Image Details

See [Images](#images) for resources on choosing the right image format and file optimization.

- Size: Export images to a max width of `1280 px` (considered full-width-esque) at a resolution of `72 px` and any width below depending on your content.
- Format: If it’s a photo, save as a JPG; and if it’s *not* a photo, save as a PNG.
- Name: Use a meaningful filename, in all-lowercase, and separate words with hyphens. See [Naming guidelines](https://developers.google.com/style/filenames) and <cite>[Dashes vs. underscores](https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/dashes-vs-underscores/)</cite> for details.
  - Use the filename convention of case, letter, first name initial followed by last name (surname) combined with the best practice of all-lowercase and separate words with hyphens.
    - For example: `project-detail-1.png`

**Notes:**

- For animation(s), without sound, use an animated GIF as the file format, and still use Markdown’s image syntax (`![Alt text description.](img/animation.gif)`).
- For video(s), try using [Video to markdown!](https://video-to-markdown.netlify.app) to generate the necessary Markdown.
