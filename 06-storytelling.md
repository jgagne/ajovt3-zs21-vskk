# Title of Article/Presentation/Talk

by Name Surname

<!--

Consider this structure as guidance only:

1. An introduction, give personal context, and make the reason for the title clear
   - Early inspiration and personal connection
2. Early education and inspiration, what you learned, and educate
    - How the past has influenced today, bring us up-to-date, who you are as design because of the past
3. Discuss where you are today and what you're doing
   -  Perhaps show us current inspiration, or examples of work that could benefit from your design philosophy, educate for change
4. Discuss your personal design philosophy in detail and share examples
    - Show work that supports your design story and person design philosophy, maybe work that inspires you today, and the work you're doing
5. A summary, what are the takeaways, what can the audience learn from your design story?
    - End the journey by reconnecting to where you started, the changes, the lessons learned and leave with a personal and positive message relating back to your title

## Homework

1. Start thinking about your story as a designer.

  - Consider the following questions (and perhaps make some notes):
    - Why do you love what you do?
    - What do you believe in? What’s your design philosophy?
    - Who inspired/inspires you?
    - Where does your inspiration come from?
    - When was that aha moment?

  - And read the following three [design stories ↓](#design-stories).

2. Watch (or rewatch) the following design stories:
  - [How to (Properly) Break Your Design System](https://www.adobe.com/max/2021/sessions/how-to-properly-break-your-design-system-s190.html)

  - [Sutnar on Sutnar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDLwOMPo_uA)
  - [State of the Web](https://vimeo.com/641568337)

3. Start a written outline, a mind map, and a list of resource links for *your* design story based  on the questions from the initial homework prompt ↑.
  - See readings for [preparation](#preparation), [storytelling](#storytelling-1), and [mind mapping tools](#mind-mapping-tools) for guidance and inspiration.

4. Read [Voice, Tone, and Style](#voice-tone-and-style) readings for added inspiration and develop a work-in-progress presentation in Markdown. See [Handoff](#handoff) for details.
