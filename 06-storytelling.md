## Homework

1. Start thinking about your story as a designer.

  - Consider the following questions (and perhaps make some notes):
    - Why do you love what you do?
    - What do you believe in? What’s your design philosophy?
    - Who inspired/inspires you?
    - Where does your inspiration come from?
    - When was that aha moment?

  - And read the following three [design stories ↓](#design-stories).

2. Watch (or rewatch) the following design stories:
  - [How to (Properly) Break Your Design System](https://www.adobe.com/max/2021/sessions/how-to-properly-break-your-design-system-s190.html)

3. Start a written outline, a mind map, and a list of resource links for *your* design story based  on the questions from the initial homework prompt ↑.
