  - Consider the following questions (and perhaps make some notes):

    - What do you believe in? What’s your design philosophy?
    - Who inspired/inspires you?
    - Where does your inspiration come from?
    - When was that aha moment?

  - And read the following three [design stories ↓](#design-stories).

2. Watch (or rewatch) the following design stories:
